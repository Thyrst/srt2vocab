1
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:21,791
Geralt!

2
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,250
I was only at the market, Yen.

3
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,916
I made more than a few pennies
thanks to your garden.

4
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,916
I can't wait to grow old together.

5
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,333
You, me, and her.

6
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,916
The family we always dreamed of.

7
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,083
<i>That's a… very…</i>

8
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,416
<i>Pretty dream.</i>

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,416
<i>Pretty dream…</i>

10
00:00:59,125 --> 00:00:59,958
Geralt!

11
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,000
Give her to me.

12
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:11,958
She's ours.

13
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,000
Fuck.

14
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,708
I don't want you…

15
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,291
I said don't touch me.

16
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,583
Wake up.

17
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:46,791
Don't touch me!

18
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,791
We're moving away from Cintra.

19
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,000
Fuck.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,833
Finally, an honest response.

21
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,291
- Ow!
- We're stuck here together.

22
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,000
Who knows,
maybe we'll be friends yet again.

23
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,541
We'll be saved.

24
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,083
I have faith.

25
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,875
Forget faith. We've got power.

26
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,250
Keep them close.

27
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,166
Where are you taking us?

28
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,083
I'm a citizen of Nilfgaard.

29
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,416
The soldiers you killed
were also Nilfgaardians.

30
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,708
Istredd spoke of these.

31
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,166
They look like Aretuza.

32
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,125
Built by elves to honor the prophets.

33
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,166
You set fire to them in the early wars.

34
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,083
Better lost to history than humans.

35
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,125
I've never seen so many elves.

36
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,750
I need to see her.

37
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,000
I come bearing gifts.

38
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,541
What is this place?

39
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,125
You keep behind me.

40
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,375
You keep your mouths shut.

41
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,583
Nilfgaard's fight is with
the Northern Kingdoms, not with the elves.

42
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,208
Set us free,

43
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,708
and we promise to grant you s...

44
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,041
You said gifts.

45
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,750
Hostages. Humans...

46
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:04,375
You should have hung their corpses nearby.

47
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,041
They can be of use.

48
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,833
These are human forests.

49
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,166
They're our forests.

50
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,291
This one was in dimeritium?

51
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,125
This one was a captive of Nilfgaard.

52
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,375
I'm also an elf.

53
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,208
Is this how you treat your own?

54
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,375
Do you sing our songs?

55
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,708
Do you honor our elders?

56
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,125
Have you ever shed a tear
over anything elven?

57
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,000
You are no elf.

58
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,000
- String them up.
- We've been digging here for weeks.

59
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,833
Every day increases
the risk of being found.

60
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,583
You don't lead our people any more,
Filavandrel.

61
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,666
Or has the White Robed One
visited your dreams too?

62
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,625
I'm doing everything I can
to keep you safe.

63
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,666
Once we find what we're looking for,

64
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,291
we ship their heads back to Aretuza
as a reminder of elven glory.

65
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,916
We're nearly there.

66
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,041
This is your home?

67
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,083
How many did you say there were?

68
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,625
I didn't.

69
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,083
Last I checked…

70
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
We were 20.

71
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:33,708
Now?

72
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,333
Maybe less.

73
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,125
You sure we're safe here?

74
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,416
Keep up.

75
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,166
Lambchop.

76
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,708
Here comes trouble!

77
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,083
Where the fuck have you been?

78
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,875
We thought you got lost.

79
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:18,791
Or killed.

80
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,250
Not yet.

81
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,166
Sorry.

82
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,000
- Brother!
- So!

83
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,958
- He returns.
- Come here!

84
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,208
- Knew you'd make a fuckin' entrance.
- He's back.

85
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,416
- Finally, brother.
- I knew it.

86
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,750
Wolf. You're home.

87
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,625
Finally.

88
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,000
- Vesemir.
- Huh?

89
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:40,875
Yeah.

90
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,875
I had to make a few stops.

91
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,750
Hmm.

92
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,166
He's home!

93
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,333
Brother!

94
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,000
There's the man!

95
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:05,875
So, there I am, freezing my bollocks off
in the middle of a grain field

96
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,375
for the second straight night,

97
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:13,166
when the farmer's wife comes sneaking out
to tell me that I'm wasting my time.

98
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:18,041
It wasn't a mora
her husband saw leaving that room.

99
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:19,666
No.

100
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,875
It was the fucking field hand!

101
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,416
Oh, and now she's wailing,
"Oh, what are we gonna do?"

102
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,125
"My husband won't pay you
if you don't deliver a mora head!"

103
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,958
So I pulled out my sword and I said…

104
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,875
"Bet he'll pay double
for the field hand's."

105
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,958
Good old Lambchop.

106
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,875
She returned
with two horses and a fur rug.

107
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,458
Best job I had all year.

108
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,500
Each of your faces
is cause enough for celebration.

109
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,000
You're safe. You made it back.
You made it home.

110
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,458
- Aye.
- Hear, hear!

111
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,708
Here's to another winter, together.

112
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,625
Yeah.

113
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,875
- Well said.
- Aye.

114
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,333
To breath in our lungs.

115
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,291
Hear, hear!

116
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,416
To the brothers.

117
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,375
The brothers.

118
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,666
To forgetting the fucking Path!

119
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,041
For one fucking night.

120
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,958
- Who's ready?
- Eskel!

121
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,750
Eskel's back!

122
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,125
Are you all right?
You look like day-old shit.

123
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,875
You should see the other guy.

124
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,375
Hmm.

125
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,291
The bout lasted six hours.

126
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,375
I'd have got the fucker, too,

127
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,875
if hadn't lost my elixirs.

128
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,625
Took her hand, though.

129
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,791
- What's that?
- Is that a leshy?

130
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,000
Is that a leshy?

131
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,583
- What is it?
- Walked like one.

132
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,083
Talked like one.

133
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:51,791
Sort of.

134
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,250
Sort of?

135
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,583
I haven't crossed a leshy in a while.

136
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,416
- Not in Kaedwen.
- Well, count yourselves lucky.

137
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,625
Unless you're aching for the sting
of one of their fucking roots.

138
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:09,333
Fire through the heart
is the only thing that puts one down.

139
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,916
Six hours in, that didn't occur to you?

140
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,375
Who the hell are you?

141
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,750
Princess Cirilla of Cintra.

142
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,291
Pleasure to meet you.

143
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,458
When you told me
you called the Law of Surprise...

144
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,875
…I told you, "Big mistake."

145
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,500
You said you promised
you wouldn't claim the child.

146
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,208
I said, "Good. Still a big mistake."

147
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,541
- I had to save her.
- I know.

148
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,458
And you knew I would call you out on it.

149
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,500
Yeah.

150
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,000
You brought her here anyway.

151
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,166
<i>So you're telling me</i>
<i>she escaped Nilfgaard.</i>

152
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,958
Survived the wholesale slaughter
of her kingdom.

153
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,333
How?

154
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:38,916
I asked.

155
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,791
- She lied.
- Hmm.

156
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,541
It's not like you to let it go.

157
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,708
Witchers watch for answers.

158
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,750
- I think you might've said that one.
- Oh, what was I thinking?

159
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,500
I brought her here so she'd be safe.

160
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,750
It's easier for me to protect her
within these walls.

161
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:03,750
- Long enough to watch for answers?
- Exactly. Learn who she is. What she is.

162
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,416
And how I can help her.

163
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:08,791
You say that…

164
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,750
But remember what happened the last time

165
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,500
witchers shoved their noses
into the dramas of courts and kingdoms.

166
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,708
What if your princess
is more than you bargained for?

167
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,916
I know that already.

168
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,250
Princess.

169
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:33,750
Eskel.

170
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,708
I'm just exploring.
Told Geralt I'd find a good room.

171
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,166
Well, this…

172
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,875
Isn't a castle, Your Highness.

173
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,458
They're all shitholes.

174
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,791
Tissaia said elven mages were dead.

175
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,500
She was wrong. Or lied.

176
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,791
- Hmm.
- Neither's a shock.

177
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,916
- You had a nightmare earlier.
- Night terrors are common after battle.

178
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,666
- You've had them...
- What was yours about?

179
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,875
- Is now the time to share stories...
- Do you really think I'm asking

180
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,708
because I personally give a shit?

181
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,541
Did you dream of someone hidden in a robe?

182
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,250
A black robe. How did you know that?

183
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,333
I've dreamt of one in red.

184
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,125
And our elven mage dreams of one in white.

185
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,625
Shared dreams are a powerful omen.

186
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,458
Yes, well, I'm topped off
on magical mystery at the moment.

187
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,666
What matters is, we can use this
to our advantage.

188
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,708
We need to talk to Francesca.

189
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,333
She's no reason to trust us.

190
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,000
- We need to gain favor first.
- Shocking.

191
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,583
We have to do it Yen's way again.

192
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,416
More shocking this time

193
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,625
is you finally stand to benefit.

194
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,500
This really all the hunters could find?

195
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,250
These woods are scarce of life.

196
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,625
Perhaps the others in Temeria or Redania
are having more luck.

197
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,583
They lick the boots of humans.

198
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,333
The same boots
that will eventually crush their necks.

199
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,583
You deserve better, brother.

200
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,125
All of us do.

201
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:12,541
You promised us Dol Blathanna.
How much longer must we search in vain?

202
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,000
Each sun sets on fewer elves.

203
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,625
Our land is stained, our elders dead.

204
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,166
Even our caves at the edge of the world
have fallen to monsters.

205
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,958
But we mustn't lose faith
in a bright elven future.

206
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,708
What has been need not always be.

207
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,833
I know these ruins will bear answers.

208
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,625
The visions I've had
since entering these woods give faith.

209
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,041
The white robe hides her face,

210
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,000
but I know it's Ithlinne,
our most sacred prophet,

211
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,041
guiding us to safe havens.

212
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,875
We will rebuild.

213
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,166
Not meat, but it'll dull your hunger.

214
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,666
I will not let us down.

215
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,750
What has been need not always be.

216
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,291
I've never heard it sung with words.

217
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,708
The heimlon you were playing.

218
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,916
A man I knew,
he said it was to guide lost elves home.

219
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,416
Those I've lost, yes.
Dead elves and orphaned elves.

220
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,958
The lyrics change often.

221
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:37,250
The White Flame wants to punish
the very people who oppress yours.

222
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,291
Thieving a thief
merely makes you the latest thief.

223
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:46,208
Or tell me, does the White Flame intend
to hand Xintrea back

224
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,541
when he's done
dancing on Calanthe's grave?

225
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,500
- Xintrea?
- Cintra's elven name before it was stolen.

226
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,666
Are you the Filavandrel of the songs?

227
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,916
The edge of the world?
The leader who rose against the lioness?

228
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,750
The lying bard and his tunes.

229
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:11,708
If I remember right, the bard's songs
claim that you were king of the elves.

230
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,250
My people turned to Francesca
after I failed to beat Calanthe.

231
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,291
They needed faith.

232
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,791
Faith's a simple medicine
for desperate souls.

233
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,833
Faith sustains us all in dark times.

234
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,958
Your… seduction,

235
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,625
whilst charming, it lacks
the cunning of your father's blood.

236
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,625
Yes, well, he was half elf.

237
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,708
I heard there hasn't been
a pure-blooded elf born in decades.

238
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,708
We've dreamt of robed figures too.

239
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:44,791
Guiding us.

240
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,000
Hers is red. Mine is black.

241
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:54,583
If you free us, perhaps we can work
together. Figure out their meaning.

242
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,375
You've been digging here for how long?

243
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,708
Perhaps we're the key.

244
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,958
We've found something!

245
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:09,875
Close.

246
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,041
Very close.

247
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,500
It hides in forests?

248
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,833
- There are others like it?
- A few.

249
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,583
Dying out, though,
because they can't reproduce.

250
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,375
Any you come across will have been around
since the Conjunction.

251
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,833
So,
is that what we'll be doing here, then?

252
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,166
Studying monsters.

253
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:50,791
Yeah.

254
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,416
Collecting supplies
for those potions you take?

255
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,125
Sure.

256
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,083
Training?

257
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,666
Training…

258
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,666
Is dangerous.

259
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,041
So's the man with the black-winged helmet.

260
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,166
And you want to kill him?

261
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:23,875
Yes.

262
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,333
Why?

263
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,166
I hate him.

264
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,666
This is important.

265
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,041
We don't kill out of fear.

266
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,625
We kill to save lives.

267
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,583
Do you understand?

268
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Hmm.

269
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,250
Well, how did you spend your days
when you first came here?

270
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,833
I was beaten and starved.

271
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,416
How's your room?

272
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,458
- It has rats.
- That's a good sign.

273
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,166
Means it's one of the warm ones.

274
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,416
What's that?

275
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,125
Stay here.

276
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,375
- You know, in Cintra, I went to parties...
- Cirilla.

277
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,041
Here's a good one!
Step over that bugle…

278
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,875
So this is where witchers are hatched.

279
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,750
I hope there's a plaque
to commemorate your greatness.

280
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,875
Tavern outside Dorian,
handful of years ago.

281
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,208
I bathed basilisk blood from your hair.

282
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,791
It was wyvern blood.

283
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,666
You shouldn't be here.

284
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,541
I hear that you have a daughter now.

285
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,708
And I thought the softest thing
about you was that you paid.

286
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,708
She's not my daughter.

287
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,416
Oh. Well, in that case,
I could take her in.

288
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,791
She'd have the boys
eating out of her hand... Ooh!

289
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,125
And he says he's not a father.

290
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,333
What is this?

291
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,833
Eskel found some friends
down the mountain.

292
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,833
They shouldn't be here.
And they should know better.

293
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,333
He drank too much stramonium
for that sting, I reckon.

294
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:11,791
- Here!
- They all did.

295
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,500
Get me another drink!

296
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,083
They won't remember anything
by tomorrow.

297
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,333
Certainly not how they got here.

298
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:22,791
Wrong destination!

299
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,041
So one of my regular clients, a druid,

300
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,916
he was telling me
leshies are giant talking trees.

301
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,583
They're beautiful, too.

302
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,750
- We don't pay for talk.
- All right.

303
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:46,708
Okay.

304
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,958
Eskel, what are you doing?

305
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:57,041
Are you takin' a break
from tuckin' in your girl?

306
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,291
I understand that you're in pain,

307
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:03,375
and you can drown that pain
with whomever you want.

308
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,500
Just not here.

309
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,916
Aah, it's funny, you know.

310
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:13,875
Me and the boys, we come back here,
all banged up.

311
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,583
Rock troll bust Lambert's eye.

312
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,833
A werewolf took a chunk
out of Coen's arse. Eh?

313
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,500
And what do you come back with?

314
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:24,583
All I say is,

315
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,708
when I find a princess…

316
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,791
…the last thing I'm gonna do is…

317
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:32,625
Play knight.

318
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,583
Eskel.

319
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:49,916
Go to bed.

320
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Hmm?

321
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,541
We need a plan.

322
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,791
- What is wrong with you?
- I feel off.

323
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:13,958
The dimeritium.

324
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,750
On your feet. Up!

325
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,250
Where are you taking us?

326
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:24,625
You kill me, the White Flame
will hold no mercy hunting you down.

327
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:28,000
Do you humans ever stop talking?

328
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,208
- What is this?
- Runes of some sort. Linked by…

329
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,791
Chaos?

330
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:49,416
This one's different.
The arrival of monsters.

331
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,166
The Conjunction of the Spheres.

332
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:58,208
The heavens roared
and the realms collided.

333
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,291
Its survivors…

334
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:06,125
lost and forsaken in a new world.

335
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,416
New to you.

336
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,375
It was ours.

337
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:13,416
Your dreams. Tell me.

338
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:16,875
Show us yours first.
This works both ways now.

339
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:23,916
In my vision,
I'm lost in a maze of dead bodies,

340
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,000
elves stacked so high they shade the sun.

341
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:31,250
Ithlinne guides me clear the labyrinth,

342
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:34,000
where I see the sun rise
on a new elven kingdom.

343
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,583
My guide's not Ithlinne. It's Emhyr.

344
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:42,666
I can't see him. He's hooded.

345
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:46,458
He just returned to Nilfgaard.
He killed the Usurper.

346
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:48,750
He saved me.

347
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,833
And yours?

348
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,000
What are you doing?

349
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:16,375
It's Elder speech, but primitive.

350
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:19,208
"Behold the mother of forests,

351
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:22,166
the deathless mother, nesting in dreams."

352
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:25,875
The rest is gibberish.

353
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:28,041
No. It's an incantation.

354
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:30,416
About a hut, with no doors.

355
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,958
My father,
he used to scare us with stories

356
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:35,750
about the witch in the woods,

357
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:39,583
her home perched on basilisk legs.

358
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:43,208
She would lure the children in
to be boiled and eaten.

359
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:47,375
Wouldn't be the first time mankind
cried "witch" at the sight of elven power.

360
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,750
My brother's right.

361
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,000
These are our ancestors,
kneeling, worshiping.

362
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:55,208
Perhaps this deathless mother's
one of the old gods.

363
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,041
First you say it's Ithlinne,
then it's one of the old gods.

364
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:01,333
What designs would either have
with two humans?

365
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,583
<i>Turn your back to the forest.</i>

366
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:19,541
She's calling us.

367
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:23,583
Stand guard until we've returned.

368
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:24,750
- Francesca.
- No.

369
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:28,250
Gage, I swore I'd take care of you
since we were children.

370
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,500
Now let me take care of us all.

371
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:37,250
Do she and I get a vote

372
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,750
- on joining your prayer circle?
- What do you think?

373
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:18,583
Newcomers always struggle sleeping
their first nights.

374
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,750
It's the chill.

375
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:27,541
Klef here was one of the first witchers.

376
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:30,000
Before my time.

377
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:32,875
What happened to him?

378
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,500
One of the oldest monsters. A demon.

379
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,250
Long extinct.

380
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:43,375
She wreaked havoc until the witchers
bound her deep in the forest.

381
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,166
That's what she used to kill him.

382
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:52,458
Some say
she still calls to the unfortunate souls

383
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,291
unlucky enough to cross her woods.

384
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:56,875
Lures them in to devour them.

385
00:29:58,791 --> 00:30:01,083
Scary stories don't really work on me.

386
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,458
And this one, Deglan,

387
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:10,041
was killed by men right in these halls.

388
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:14,041
He taught me everything I know.

389
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,708
Made me a witcher.

390
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,541
He was like a father to you, wasn't he?
As you're Geralt's.

391
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,958
Something like that.

392
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:26,375
It is easier when they're young.

393
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:29,625
Wait for them
to finish crying for Ma and feed them,

394
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:33,875
train them, send them out into the world,
and see who comes back alive.

395
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:40,416
You don't frighten easily.

396
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:45,458
There's times to stand still,
and there's times to keep moving.

397
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:47,666
Did that mantra help you escape Cintra?

398
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:51,458
Geralt said I'd be protected here.

399
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:54,125
It's hard to do
when I don't know who I'm protecting.

400
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:56,541
Or what I'm protecting her from.

401
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:11,250
You took on that wooden beast.

402
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,541
Let me take on yours!

403
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:14,708
Oh!

404
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:37,750
Come on. Keep moving.

405
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,791
If you dreamt of Emhyr,

406
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:47,833
why were you so terrified when you woke?

407
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,375
Tell me.

408
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:56,583
I'm in the dark.

409
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,458
There are people over me…

410
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:01,333
Touching me.

411
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:03,541
Just gentle taps.

412
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,166
I can't see them. I can't stop them. So…

413
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,000
I just lay there and let them.

414
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,833
After the Usurper executed Fergus,

415
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:19,958
he had all of the mages moved to a prison.

416
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:23,958
Uh…

417
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,541
A playhouse.

418
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:30,500
I was there for years.
Then Emhyr found me.

419
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,250
<i>I could go walking…</i>

420
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:44,708
<i>…if you were alive…</i>

421
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:46,791
A hut with no doors.

422
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:49,083
- The inscription.
- Wait.

423
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:54,041
If you're wrong,
if the dreams don't mean what you think...

424
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:58,000
Behold the mother of forests,
the deathless mother, nesting in dreams.

425
00:32:58,666 --> 00:33:01,625
Turn your back to the forest, hut, hut.

426
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:03,833
Turn your front to me,

427
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,166
hut, hut.

428
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,208
- Have you seen Cirilla?
- Yeah.

429
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:28,041
I saw her pounding White Gull
and dancing on the table.

430
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:29,958
- Funny.
- Mmm.

431
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,500
I caught her spying.

432
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:40,208
Geralt, it's her first night here.
What did you expect?

433
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:42,791
I was hoping she'd do as I say.

434
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:44,625
Kids never do what you say.

435
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:45,708
Hmm.

436
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:48,291
We had a chat, and then I sent her to bed.

437
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:51,583
Are you sure you're ready for this?

438
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:59,958
I was in a cell beneath the city
when Cintra was sacked.

439
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:01,666
I heard it all.

440
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,958
Fire, screams, and death.

441
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,000
The same sounds
that I heard here as a boy,

442
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:11,291
hiding in the cellar,

443
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,375
waiting for the humans to come for us.

444
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:20,125
You were the last surviving witcher
after Kaer Morhen fell.

445
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:23,791
You and a batch of mutated orphans

446
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:26,208
with nowhere else to go.

447
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:29,666
Were you ready?

448
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:31,333
No.

449
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:33,125
But you protected us anyway.

450
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,125
No.

451
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:37,083
I taught you how to fend for yourselves.

452
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,125
- No!
- Hey!

453
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:04,125
Maybe Eskel's leshy wants its hand back.

454
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,666
Wield your wits, boys.

455
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:13,166
- I'll secure the guests.
- I'll check the wing.

456
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,625
- We'll check the perimeter.
- Follow me! Get a move on!

457
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,041
- Let's go!
- Move it!

458
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,833
- I'll find Cirilla.
- No.

459
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,916
Do what you do best.

460
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:23,875
Stay and fight.

461
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,375
Look alive, girl! We've got company.

462
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,291
- What are you doing? Stay back.
- Hey!

463
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:39,250
Don't barge into a girl's room
waving about a sword, you moron!

464
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:42,541
Stand guard outside.

465
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:45,416
I was following fucking orders.

466
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:48,083
Come on, let's go! Move it!

467
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:26,833
Where are you?

468
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,000
What are you?

469
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,500
Hello.

470
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:29,083
Don't be scared.

471
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:30,666
I'm here to help you.

472
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,333
Ithlinne?

473
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,833
I knew it.

474
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:38,791
You're not him.

475
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,250
I know what you are.

476
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,791
An old wives' tale for children.

477
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:48,250
Are you a child, Fringilla?

478
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:52,333
Did I save you from the playhouse
to be a child?

479
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:55,333
I'm not scared.

480
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:57,500
And I don't do help.

481
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:59,833
Yes, you don't need anyone.

482
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:02,750
You have nothing to hide here.

483
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:03,750
I know.

484
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,208
It's just… the path has been hard.

485
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:09,083
And the path forward will be harder still.

486
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:10,916
But I can help you.

487
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:15,666
And yet…

488
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:18,541
You've stayed for decades.

489
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:21,041
Why?

490
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Is it love?

491
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:25,375
Legacy, you say?

492
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:28,916
Power!

493
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:30,916
That's what you live for.

494
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:33,833
That's your play?
It's rather desperate.

495
00:38:33,916 --> 00:38:36,041
You're the desperate one, Yennefer.

496
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:37,625
The most.

497
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:45,750
You are not the new sun.

498
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:49,708
- You are not him.
- Oh, he'll never tell you what I will.

499
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:54,291
The path to true strength
lies not in humble faith,

500
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,291
but in believing in oneself…

501
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:59,833
<i>…and seizing one's destiny.</i>

502
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:07,833
The world will die in frost
and be reborn with a new sun.

503
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:12,208
But first, the earth will flow
with the blood of elves.

504
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:15,083
How do I save them?

505
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:16,583
Remove those robes.

506
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:21,333
Or what if I told you
that you could have power?

507
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:24,000
And not of a meek sycophant,

508
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,750
but as your own woman.

509
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:26,916
This isn't real.

510
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:30,833
<i>Well, imagine if it were.</i>

511
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:34,875
Imagine
that you are the emperor, right now.

512
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:40,166
The others' dreams were obvious.

513
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,916
You thought you were special.

514
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,250
But no.

515
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:46,166
Yours was obvious too.

516
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,291
Then make your ask.

517
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,875
I would rebuild our forces.

518
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:53,291
Strengthen our numbers.

519
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:58,166
We are an empire, but the North…
the North is a league of many kingdoms.

520
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,916
And a large and unpredictable land.

521
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,583
Even with numbers,
you'd be lost. You need friends.

522
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:08,500
Allies that know this land
as if it were their own.

523
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:10,750
No Northern Kingdom
would ally itself with us.

524
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:12,916
- No…
- No kingdom of men.

525
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:17,750
Do you want salvation?

526
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:22,833
Then you're bringing back
the wrong elf.

527
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,750
The first pure elf for years.

528
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:34,000
A new hope for a brighter future.

529
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,833
I've been with child before.

530
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:37,500
None have come to term.

531
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:38,666
But if it could?

532
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,375
If I could help you?

533
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:43,041
All you need to do is ask.

534
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,000
You're not Ithlinne, are you?

535
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:49,833
Your ancestors' faith
was better than yours.

536
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:51,875
<i>Better than yours.</i>

537
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:53,250
Then make your ask.

538
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:56,375
What must I do?

539
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,958
To see your child live,

540
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,250
you must live first

541
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:03,750
amongst men.

542
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:07,291
Xintrea!

543
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,208
You're no longer bound.

544
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,916
Why haven't you thought
to portal yourself free?

545
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:20,750
You've felt it since Sodden,

546
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:22,416
haven't you?

547
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:25,583
Or rather…

548
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,458
<i>…haven't </i>felt it.

549
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:33,583
But you'd rather be blind
than see the truth.

550
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:37,041
Remember this lesson, Piglet?

551
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:51,708
<i>Zeilil eip.</i>

552
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:55,125
<i>Zeilil eip.</i>

553
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:58,791
<i>Zeilil eip.</i>

554
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:01,125
<i>Zeilil eip.</i>

555
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,625
You blew it at Sodden.

556
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:06,500
Fire is dangerous magic.

557
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:08,416
Farewell, Chaos!

558
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,291
What will she live for now?

559
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:14,250
<i>Zeilil eip. Zeilil eip.</i>

560
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:17,083
Move, damn it!

561
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:19,041
Fucking parlor tricks!

562
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:20,916
Yes, denial!

563
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:23,625
A tasty garnish.

564
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,958
I'm going to let you bake some more.

565
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,083
I want your desperation crisp.

566
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:49,166
You will beg me to take it from you.

567
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:52,958
And I will.

568
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:33,666
Eskel?

569
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,791
Geralt.

570
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,833
Eskel!

571
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:27,666
I came… back here.

572
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:31,375
I knew something…

573
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:32,916
Was wrong.

574
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,916
I don't know what happened.

575
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,750
But I thought…

576
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:40,916
I thought I could fight it.

577
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:46,125
I thought…

578
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:48,208
You could…

579
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:50,416
Help…

580
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,333
Me.

581
00:45:58,375 --> 00:45:59,375
Vesemir.

582
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:08,291
Should've known better than to bring
my whores to a witcher den.

583
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:09,333
Danica, you fool.

584
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:12,333
Stay here. Take cover.

585
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:13,833
No.

586
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:15,750
No, no, no. Lambert!

587
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:19,916
Fuck this. I'm not dying here.
What's the quickest way out, girl?

588
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,750
There's stairs to the north of the hall,
a turret to the south… I don't know.

589
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:25,708
- All right, come on.
- No.

590
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,666
- We have to stay. Geralt...
- Geralt may be dead already!

591
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:32,916
Look, witchers fight. We run.

592
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:36,291
Go. Go!

593
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:41,000
Go.

594
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:47,958
What is this?

595
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:49,041
It's Eskel.

596
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:51,166
The leshy's infected him.

597
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:53,875
That's not possible.

598
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:16,291
The door! Go!

599
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,833
Eskel.

600
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:52,583
We need time.

601
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:54,291
We can save you.

602
00:48:03,666 --> 00:48:04,916
Eskel…

603
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,833
Please… stop…

604
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:56,458
You did what you had to do.

605
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:31,583
There you are.

606
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:33,458
It's all right.

607
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:37,500
You saw her too.

608
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,666
Don't worry. You're free.

609
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:43,375
You're going with them.

610
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:47,416
Francesca claims the old gods want
an alliance between elves and Nilfgaard.

611
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,041
- I agreed.
- Then you're both fools.

612
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:52,958
You know that evil witch is no god.

613
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:55,208
I know my faith brought me this far.

614
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:58,625
- I'll see how much further it can take me.
- That sounded like ambition.

615
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:01,458
- Impossible.
- Not as impossible as you finding meaning.

616
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,416
What did you ask for?

617
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,791
- An end to this nonsense.
- Oh, glib as ever.

618
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:07,791
Uh...

619
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:09,875
If she really is that evil,

620
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,208
why did she let you go?

621
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:53,375
Is it over?

622
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:55,791
We're safe now?

623
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,375
Are you okay?

624
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,083
I'm all right.

625
00:51:10,416 --> 00:51:11,416
Come with me.

626
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:31,500
When I first came to Kaer Morhen,

627
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:36,958
Vesemir said to me
that the world outside these walls

628
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:39,625
is a dangerous place.

629
00:51:49,875 --> 00:51:51,708
<i>But times are changing,</i>

630
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:54,208
<i>even here.</i>

631
00:51:58,625 --> 00:51:59,833
<i>Nowhere's safe now.</i>

632
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:04,958
<i>You can't run from the world.</i>

633
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:07,916
<i>You can't hide from it.</i>

634
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:10,083
Eskel.

635
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:12,208
- Eskel.
- For the brothers.

636
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:15,791
But you can find power

637
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,958
and purpose.

638
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,208
A chance to survive the horror.

639
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:13,791
<i>This Continent…</i>

640
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,875
<i>Was meant for no one.</i>

641
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,500
All you have to do, Ciri,

642
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:22,166
is keep your sword close

643
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:23,666
and keep moving.
