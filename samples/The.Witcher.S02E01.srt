1
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,666
Colin!

2
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,166
Colin, where is everybody?

3
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:46,958
Hello?

4
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,583
Hello?

5
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,750
I'm in need of lodgings for the night!

6
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:55,958
I'm a merchant.

7
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,500
I can pay.

8
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,291
Hello?

9
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,125
Hello!

10
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,958
I'm in need of lodgings for...

11
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,041
Kira!

12
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,666
Kira!

13
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,083
- Spare me!
- Not today.

14
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,375
Please have mercy...

15
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,916
Take him. Leave me be.

16
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:27,583
Please!

17
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,750
Yennefer?

18
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,416
4,000 dead Temerian soldiers,

19
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,000
5,000 dead Kaedwenians,

20
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,416
and at least 20,000 of theirs.

21
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,333
You won't find her in your visions.

22
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,958
She's gone.

23
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,291
Yennefer?

24
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:38,708
Yennefer…

25
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,750
Yennefer!

26
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,333
Yennefer!

27
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,208
I've seen this.

28
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,500
Stay on the horse.

29
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,333
Where is she?

30
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,041
And who are you to her, exactly?

31
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,250
Is she alive?

32
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,583
We won. Because of her.

33
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,000
She bought us time
until the armies arrived.

34
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,208
Was it worth it?

35
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,833
Yennefer.

36
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,833
Can you please tell me who she is?

37
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,875
Doesn't matter.

38
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,625
She's gone now.

39
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,125
Let me go.

40
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Let me go!

41
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,541
I sleep like shit too.

42
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,000
You don't sleep at all.

43
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,541
Makes for fewer nightmares.

44
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,583
Except for the one about the rock troll.

45
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,750
Overly friendly.

46
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,833
Tough image to shake.

47
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,833
What about yours?

48
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,791
The Black Knight has me on his horse…

49
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,708
Cintra is burning.

50
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,375
I'm too helpless to stop any of it.

51
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,708
You escaped.

52
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,458
I was lucky.

53
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,916
I… need to understand some things.

54
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,166
You claimed the Law of Surprise
and got me.

55
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,583
Why?

56
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,666
It was payment for a debt.

57
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,791
I saved your father's life.

58
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,458
- From what?
- Your grandmother.

59
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,208
She didn't want your mother marrying a…

60
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:42,958
An outsider.

61
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,083
Your father didn't know
what he was giving up.

62
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,500
So…

63
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm your destiny.

64
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,916
- Whatever that means.
- You're much more than that, Cirilla.

65
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,833
- I miss my home.
- Cintra isn't safe for you any more.

66
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,125
Then what about Skellige?
I have people there too.

67
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,750
- I'd be safe there.
- If you want.

68
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,541
But you'd be married off
to the nearest Lord of Bad Breath.

69
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,916
He'd be seeking to claim your throne too.

70
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,875
The food is good there, though.

71
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,500
Fire!

72
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,166
- Quickly!
- Over here!

73
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,666
I'm the only fuck in here!

74
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,041
Triss!

75
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,125
Stay with us!

76
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,541
Stay with us!

77
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,250
Triss!

78
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,125
She was stable.
I don't know what happened.

79
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,083
We're losing her.

80
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,750
Mmm.

81
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,833
- What is it?
- There is no sign of Yennefer.

82
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,666
She's lost for good.

83
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,250
And what of my niece?

84
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,750
Fringilla was at the front.

85
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,416
Coordinating the Nilfgaardian attack
with the prisoner we took.

86
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,500
She has abandoned all rules of Chaos.

87
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,875
She is lost too, then.

88
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,583
Familial disgrace can wait.

89
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,041
We need intelligence
from that prisoner now.

90
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:34,625
The kings have their blood up.
They want to chase Nilfgaard south.

91
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,458
Perhaps we should, since
you'd have us be warriors in the field

92
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,958
- instead of advisers in the palace.
- You weren't there, Artorius.

93
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,041
We won. But barely.

94
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,500
We do not know the troops
that Nilfgaard have in reserve,

95
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,916
where they are reassembling,
what they are planning next.

96
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,916
The prisoner.

97
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,875
What do we know?

98
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,708
Our spies don't have much.

99
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,250
Only that he orchestrated
the fall of Cintra.

100
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,958
And that he doesn't answer to
the generals, only to the emperor himself.

101
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,708
No one's been able to break him.

102
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,000
He will give us everything we need…

103
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,416
If I can have time with him.

104
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,041
We have rules.

105
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,333
She wasn't asking your permission.

106
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,041
She's awake.

107
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,500
Welcome back.

108
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,916
Wasn't sure you'd make it.

109
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:08,875
Fuck.

110
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,333
So, what exactly is Kaer Morhen?

111
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,375
It's where witchers go
during the winter.

112
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,708
There, we can rest up and heal.
Replace armor and elixirs.

113
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,333
It's my home.

114
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,791
How come I've never heard of it?

115
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,916
Because we like it that way.

116
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:38,750
Why?

117
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,666
There was an attack.

118
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,166
A long time ago, when I was a boy.

119
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,625
Almost wiped us all out.

120
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,916
So now, we like to keep a low profile.

121
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,250
Hmm.

122
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,750
In Cintra, I used to dress up like a boy
just so I could play knucklebones.

123
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,916
We both need
to keep a low profile, it seems.

124
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,541
Were you attacked
because you're different?

125
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,083
Sure. We can't see the future
like you can.

126
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:25,125
Back on the battlefield, when you saw me
and that woman before it happened.

127
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,916
Yes, well, it was…
it was more like a dream.

128
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:34,875
Hazy. It was…

129
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:36,666
It was weird.

130
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:09,875
Easy.

131
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,083
How did you do that?

132
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,500
It's called <i>axii.</i>

133
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,666
It's a calming sign.

134
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,000
Magic. Like… like a druid?

135
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,583
Not really.

136
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,000
We should keep moving.

137
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,416
Oh, thank gods.

138
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,625
Think there's an inn?

139
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,666
Hmm.

140
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,083
Come on, Roach.

141
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,916
[metal creaking

142
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:33,791
What is it?

143
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,958
There are no guards.

144
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,791
- Maybe hiding...
- Quiet.

145
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,625
There are no barking dogs, either.

146
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,625
This place never sleeps.

147
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,958
- So what now?
- I know somewhere nearby. An old friend.

148
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,916
Stay on Roach.

149
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,625
Geralt!

150
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,083
Nivellen?

151
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,500
What the fuck are you doing here,
you old whoreson?

152
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,375
This is your friend?

153
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,458
Yeah…

154
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,791
- But he's changed.
- I know.

155
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,916
I look a tad different
since you saw me last.

156
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,000
But I could say the same of you.

157
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,500
Put away your knife
and come in out of the cold, Witcher.

158
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,583
I'll tell you everything.

159
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,041
Eh?

160
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,500
A fire for my guests.

161
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,750
And you, my dear…

162
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,500
Ciri.

163
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,416
Well, Ciri, what say you to a hot bath

164
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,666
to warm your frozen bones?

165
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,041
Oh, I'd love one.

166
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,791
- We're only staying until the storm dies.
- Please.

167
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,208
Splendid.

168
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,208
Bath!

169
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,166
You can bathe in the next room.

170
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,250
I'm fine.

171
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,958
You, my friend, are very far from fine.

172
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,125
You reek of old horse.

173
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,750
Part of my charm.

174
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,375
You always were a horse's arse, anyway.

175
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,833
Doors!

176
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,458
How long's it been?
13 winters since we last saw each other?

177
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,583
Nivellen, I'm not one
to slight the rite of hospitality,

178
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,916
but I do need to know
that she's safe here.

179
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,083
You see my tusks and think I would…
bite the throat?

180
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,416
Hmm. She is.

181
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,541
I'm still me.

182
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,208
Well… Lights!

183
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,291
That's not a bad trick.

184
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,208
You gonna tell me what happened to you?

185
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,916
That's a tale requiring wine. What of you?

186
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,666
That's a tale requiring a wine cellar.

187
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:43,000
Numbskull took one look
at the place, tucked tail and ran so fast,

188
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,750
his feet didn't touch the ground.

189
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,291
Brigands were tougher in our days, eh?

190
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,458
Thank you so much for this.

191
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,041
My other clothes were ready
to run away by themselves.

192
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,875
But of course. Uh…

193
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,208
You look lovely.

194
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,500
Roast venison, sage truffles,

195
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,500
sweet wine, and lots of it!

196
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,458
And for you,

197
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,458
only the best.

198
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,916
Witchers' quail.

199
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,041
That's a good one.

200
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,500
I jest, I jest!

201
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,875
Mountain pheasant for my friend!

202
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,291
[laughs

203
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,083
Ah!

204
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,291
- Very good, eh?
- Mmm, very good indeed.

205
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,000
- Has he told you how we first met?
- No.

206
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,250
He's not especially chatty.

207
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,458
- No.
- I'd like to hear, though.

208
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:48,750
It's my favorite tale.
You see, this snow-capped sourpuss here

209
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,208
was hired
by the most horrible monster of all,

210
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,875
my father,

211
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,458
to clear our woods
of a wyvern infestation.

212
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,375
- I've seen those in books.
- Horrid creatures.

213
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,250
See that weak young whelp of a lad?

214
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,916
That was me.

215
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,375
And I tried to prove myself to my father

216
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,458
by killing one first.

217
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,250
But instead…

218
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,833
…I fell into the damned beast's lair.

219
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,833
This one pulls me up
by the scruff of my neck

220
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,750
and slays the wyvern
snapping at my nethers.

221
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,000
What do you think he does next?

222
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,208
What?

223
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,416
Gives me a hiding
for being such a cretinous twit? No.

224
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,750
He hands me the wyvern's head

225
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,291
and tells my father
I was the one that killed it.

226
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,958
I had to clear the forest
of the entire pack.

227
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:48,500
- Got paid either way.
- Nonsense! He's a big softie.

228
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,125
I tell you no word of a lie, young Ciri.

229
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,125
It was the first and last time…

230
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,125
…I saw my father proud of me.

231
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,333
After that,

232
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:04,083
Geralt and I became friends,
of a sort, over many a summer.

233
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,875
Since we're telling no lies,
tell us about your curse.

234
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:12,041
- In front of the girl?
- She's tougher than you think.

235
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:23,625
I was a gormless young twat.

236
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,375
That's how.

237
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,625
Fell in with a bad lot.

238
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,500
I trashed
the Temple of the Lionheaded Spider.

239
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,250
High on godflesh mushrooms.

240
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:37,291
All the mushrooms in the world
wouldn't make anyone that stupid.

241
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,958
If only it was so.

242
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,041
After the damage was done,

243
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:46,958
this priestess cursed me
to live like this.

244
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:48,916
Forever.

245
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:50,500
Alone.

246
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,041
Hmm.

247
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,833
All curses have cures. What did she say?

248
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,083
She screamed something about

249
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,000
love and blood.

250
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:06,750
I don't remember.

251
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,166
I'll be honest.

252
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,000
I've tried to end it, Geralt.

253
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,250
More than once.

254
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,291
But I kept coming back.

255
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,666
That priestess won't let me off so easy.

256
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The village below was abandoned.

257
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:40,833
What happened there?

258
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,541
After the Battle of Sodden, the…

259
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,375
Countryside is a dangerous place.

260
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,083
Hungry soldiers, deserters…

261
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:53,166
Not reason enough for an entire village
to leave their homes.

262
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,666
It is…

263
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,791
When the Wild Hunt's
riding over the horizon.

264
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,208
I saw them myself.

265
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:02,833
Just last week.

266
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:06,666
Riding their skeletal horses
across the southern sky.

267
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,750
A portent of doom.

268
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,000
The Wraiths of Mörhogg?

269
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,833
My grandfather saw them
just before Cintra fell.

270
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:15,291
Her grandfather was a drunk.

271
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,250
He saw a lot of things.

272
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,666
I'm simply saying,
the North and South at war,

273
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,333
monsters roaming
when they should be hibernating,

274
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:28,458
pestilence sweeping the land…

275
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,000
Maybe it's the end of days.

276
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:34,416
I've lived through a whole dark age
and three supposed end of days.

277
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,291
It's all horseshit.

278
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,166
No, something has changed, Geralt.

279
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:43,000
The world's acting
of its own strange accord these days.

280
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:45,791
Far outside the reach of kings and men.

281
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,708
Nivellen, do you have a cat?

282
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:53,416
The poor thing
might be stuck in the ceiling.

283
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,958
I do, in fact. She's fine.

284
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,500
Vereena, she's called.

285
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,250
I'm very glad of her company,

286
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,375
even if she's a shy wee thing.

287
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,583
Not fond of strangers.

288
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:09,125
Didn't you say
you were cursed to live alone?

289
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:12,083
Didn't you say
cats are afraid of witchers?

290
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:15,333
How about a show?

291
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:18,833
How about we scout the property?
Make sure it's secure for the night.

292
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,875
- Ugh!
- Go on, Geralt.

293
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:23,041
We'll be all right.

294
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,125
What a welcome sight.

295
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,750
Are you my inquisitor or executioner?

296
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,875
See where the night takes us.

297
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:00,583
Do what you will.

298
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,875
Make no difference in the end.

299
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:09,916
The White Flame will cleanse us all.

300
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,708
I need to know what Nilfgaard wants.

301
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,291
Resist or submit.

302
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:33,416
It makes no difference.

303
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:40,375
'Tis not in my nature…

304
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,666
To be cruel.

305
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:47,250
But you have taken someone from me.

306
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,250
Someone I care about deeply.

307
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:56,083
So now I will take your knowledge…

308
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:58,125
…your memories,

309
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,625
your very being,

310
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:03,791
and leave you cold and helpless,

311
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:07,125
trapped in the eternal darkness
of your own mind.

312
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:11,500
I know.

313
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,625
I know you want to scream.

314
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,958
But it's too soon.

315
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:21,125
It's too soon
because I haven't even started yet.

316
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:27,041
If evolution has traced
any groove at all in your brain,

317
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:29,916
I will plough it somewhat deeper.

318
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,875
And then you will know
what a scream can really be!

319
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,666
This the best you can conjure up?

320
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,583
The battle
must have really taken it out of you.

321
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:57,791
Unlike you, I'm not one
to waste Chaos on frivolous nonsense.

322
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:00,875
I wouldn't call
burning half your forces frivolous.

323
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:05,000
Pity you're in dimeritium chains
behind enemy lines, then.

324
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,833
Or else you could
conjure us up a boar to eat.

325
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:22,666
You're on the run.

326
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,791
- We won.
- A battle. The war's just begun.

327
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:29,250
The refrain of the defeated, how sad.

328
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,000
Sodden was merely a raindrop
before the storm.

329
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:33,458
Look at you.

330
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:37,416
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I'm loyal to my kingdom.

331
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,958
No, your precious leader's
after something.

332
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,166
You're a pawn to get to it.

333
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:45,291
I can't imagine… What's his name, Emhyr?

334
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:49,958
My humble apologies,
the mighty White Flame himself…

335
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:54,541
Can't imagine he'll be too happy
to see you return, tail between your legs.

336
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,583
You know I won't turn.

337
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:02,750
- That the Brotherhood won't negotiate.
- They won't want you back.

338
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,958
You've broken their sacred law,
tapped into fire magic.

339
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,250
- At Tissaia's behest.
- Oh!

340
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:08,708
I'll be lauded for saving them.

341
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,166
I'm sure they'll be most understanding.
All leaders are.

342
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:17,958
You're offering me up as a sacrifice.

343
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,958
A bloody mea culpa for fucking up
Nilfgaard's great push north.

344
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:31,875
At least conjure me up some decent food
before we get to Shitgaard.

345
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,166
This is what you do
to keep yourself entertained?

346
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,416
To keep myself sane, yes.

347
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:46,375
It's a famous piece

348
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:50,833
I first saw as a lad
whilst studying at Oxenfurt.

349
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:52,791
Aah!

350
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,375
It tells the tale
of a doomed young Elven warrior

351
00:29:58,041 --> 00:30:00,208
and a human she falls in love with.

352
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,458
What's it called?

353
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:05,083
<i>The Fall of the Elders.</i>

354
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:11,125
<i>Elven warrior, human mage</i>

355
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:13,083
<i>Ordained by hate to kill</i>

356
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,333
<i>Instead found love and ran away</i>

357
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:18,250
<i>Against their people's will</i>

358
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:22,625
It's beautiful.

359
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,708
<i>Into bliss, the two did wed</i>

360
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,541
<i>A baby on the way</i>

361
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,833
<i>A child born to parents dead</i>

362
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,333
<i>That fateful winter's day</i>

363
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:42,333
It's as if she's determined

364
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:45,083
to do the opposite
of the thing that'll keep her safe.

365
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,750
Verbose when I need her to be quiet.

366
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:52,458
Stubborn and sullen
when I need her to talk.

367
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:57,000
Looks like you're in good company.

368
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,375
You remind me of an old friend.

369
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:03,833
Mousesack.

370
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,916
Sometimes it doesn't seem real.

371
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:13,166
That he's gone.

372
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,291
And I just...

373
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,375
I wish
I could go back in time and save him.

374
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:21,083
Save everyone.

375
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:23,041
Can I come with you?

376
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:27,166
I have a few things
I should like to change myself.

377
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,125
What's it like?

378
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,791
Being alone because of what you are?

379
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,208
It's what eats you alive.

380
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:42,541
Loneliness.

381
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:53,291
Have… have you ever tried
to cure yourself?

382
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:56,958
Oh, I've plied many a lass
with treasure to kiss me,

383
00:31:57,041 --> 00:32:00,250
hoping there was a grain of truth
to those fairy tales.

384
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:02,666
Maybe you just haven't
found the right one yet.

385
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:06,750
Mousesack told me of a hedgehog man
who was cured by true love.

386
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,458
Lucky chap.

387
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:10,958
He was probably worthy.

388
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,708
You saw my statue garden.

389
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,416
All my servants are buried there.

390
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,875
I killed them the day I turned,

391
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25,333
not knowing what I was,

392
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:27,291
not knowing my own strength.

393
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,916
I deserve my destiny.

394
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:37,083
Come.

395
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,291
I'm being a bore.

396
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,250
And you must be tired.

397
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,500
Here we are.

398
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:00,041
It's been a treat.

399
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,458
Those people you killed…

400
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:10,375
You didn't mean to.

401
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,083
Sometimes…

402
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:21,541
I think I'm still a man.

403
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:23,708
But mostly…

404
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,416
I know what I really am.

405
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:34,375
I watched my entire home

406
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:38,125
burn to the ground
at the hands of another.

407
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,333
My family trapped inside.

408
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:48,458
You don't seem like a monster to me.

409
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,791
I appreciate that, my dear.

410
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:55,208
Monsters are more

411
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:58,125
than just horrid looks
and claws and teeth.

412
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:01,750
Monsters are born of deeds done.

413
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,250
Unforgivable ones.

414
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:11,083
Good night.

415
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,291
Good night, Nivellen.

416
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:41,125
Finest mead from the rarest
Korathian desert honey.

417
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:50,541
- Aah.
- Let's play a drinking game.

418
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,791
Oh, now we're talking!

419
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:54,583
What sort?

420
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:57,791
We throw daggers.

421
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:01,041
Whoever misses your dear father's head

422
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:02,500
drinks…

423
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,666
And tells a truth.

424
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,875
Prepare to lose.

425
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,833
- You first.
- Hmm.

426
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,708
Let's start with the obvious.

427
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,750
How in the name of all that's sacred…

428
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:29,875
How did you find yourself
looking after a young girl?

429
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:32,250
I promised her grandmother
before she died.

430
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:42,916
What's your plan?

431
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:44,666
Keep her alive.

432
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:46,916
That's it?

433
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,583
I can protect her
from any mark of man or monster.

434
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,541
And you said so yourself.
The world is changing.

435
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:57,041
Perhaps that's why the Law of Surprise
brought us together.

436
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:59,375
Oh, that devious old chestnut.

437
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,958
- Hmm.
- The plot thickens, huh?

438
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:06,500
- Your turn.
- Oh-ho-ho-ho.

439
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:11,166
Bull's-eye.

440
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:25,708
You've become a lightweight, old friend.

441
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:27,583
So it seems.

442
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:29,875
You spend a lifetime alone,

443
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:34,041
then you claim a child
of an ancient promise of destiny.

444
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:36,875
What changed you?

445
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:39,625
Who.

446
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:43,833
Yennefer of Vengerberg.

447
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,083
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

448
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:50,500
And where is this rarest
and fairest of all maidens?

449
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:53,583
The one who could crack
an icy witcher's heart?

450
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:54,875
She's dead.

451
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:03,708
I'm sorry, my boy.

452
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:06,291
How long ago?

453
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,541
A few days.

454
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:16,291
How are you not heartbroken?

455
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:19,750
Who says I'm not?

456
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:30,541
- Your horse, it's lame.
- I know.

457
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:32,958
If I dismount, my men will eat it.

458
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,291
Horses, whores, and mages.
All useful till we're not.

459
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,083
Do you really think
offering me as a sacrifice

460
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:44,083
will be enough to spare your failure?

461
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:46,791
You'll watch my head roll
right before your own.

462
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:52,125
- Look. The North has won.
- Hmm.

463
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:55,583
Join us. I'll tell them you saved me.
You can redeem yourself.

464
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,375
Redeem myself from what, exactly?

465
00:38:58,041 --> 00:39:01,916
You think that we ventured north
to conquer? We came to liberate.

466
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,416
You were weak at Aretuza,
but you had your own mind.

467
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,166
That implies choice.

468
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,041
I was placed in a kingdom at the whim
of the Brotherhood's wants. We all were.

469
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,791
Just gilded pawns
to control kingdoms, nothing more.

470
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,708
We weren't forced to do anything.

471
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:17,041
Should I have left my post as you did?

472
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,500
Shirked my duties, wasted my talents?

473
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:23,458
- If I'd had Tissaia to shield me...
- If you'd thought for yourself

474
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,000
instead of licking others' boots.

475
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,416
Eager to please. Easy to wound.

476
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,833
You're blind, Yennefer.

477
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,250
Anything else?

478
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,208
I have nothing to hide.

479
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,625
From me, maybe.

480
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:44,416
But have you told the girl the truth?

481
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:50,458
That witchers obtain children
so they can feed them with magic herbs.

482
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:54,250
The few who survive
become witchers themselves.

483
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:57,875
All human feelings and reactions
are trained out of them.

484
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:00,666
They are turned into monsters

485
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,375
to kill other monsters.

486
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:04,333
That's not going to happen to her.

487
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:05,916
But it happened to you.

488
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:12,875
For better or worse,

489
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:14,833
she's with you now.

490
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,625
How does she feel about it?

491
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:21,250
Ohh!

492
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:24,916
The look of a man
who's worried he's lost his touch.

493
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,375
Hmm.

494
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,208
The look of a man who's wondering
why his old friend is cheating.

495
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:37,750
You've got me there!

496
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:41,875
Magic knives.

497
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:44,916
But why?

498
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:49,083
I've seen you piss yourself
in a wyvern den.

499
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:53,583
I know who you truly are.
What are you hiding now?

500
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:01,583
I need to drain the snake
and hit the silk.

501
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,166
Go to sleep, you sullen old codger.

502
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,916
See you in the morning.

503
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,666
It's all right, Vereena.

504
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:21,625
We won't hurt you.

505
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:25,416
We're just here for the night.

506
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:28,583
Then you can have your house back.

507
00:41:58,666 --> 00:41:59,958
Hmm.

508
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,708
Hmm.

509
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:41,375
Who are you?

510
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:45,000
I'm Vereena. A friend of Nivellen.

511
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:51,416
You were having a nightmare.
I came to check on you.

512
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:56,875
Did you like the dress I left for you?

513
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:00,125
That was you?

514
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,833
Yes.

515
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:05,500
Thank you.

516
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:10,041
- Nivellen said you were a cat.
- Mmm.

517
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:12,875
What are you?

518
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:16,875
<i>I am different. I am not you.</i>

519
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:20,291
<i>But I am like you.</i>

520
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:23,125
How did you do that?

521
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:25,583
I've never met anyone…

522
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:27,958
Alone in the heart, like you.

523
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:29,750
Different.

524
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:32,625
Not one of many.

525
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:36,416
Oh…

526
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,208
Why do you travel with that man?

527
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,250
I know what he is.

528
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:42,375
He kills things.

529
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:45,250
Monsters, yes.

530
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,250
Kills them.

531
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:49,333
Hmm.

532
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:51,875
Are you a monster?

533
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:56,541
Are you a monster
because you are different?

534
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:59,666
Monsters do bad things to people.

535
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,916
Humans do bad things to everybody.

536
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,916
Mmm.

537
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:05,708
Nivellen…

538
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:09,250
He hid you from the witcher.

539
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:15,333
He loves you.

540
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:17,916
Mmm.

541
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,000
<i>This must be our secret.</i>

542
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,416
<i>Until you leave.</i>

543
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:31,750
Hmm.

544
00:45:58,583 --> 00:45:59,791
It flies.

545
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:04,208
- Geralt?
- Roach is by the gate.

546
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:07,458
If anyone other than me leaves this place,
ride for your life.

547
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:10,125
- What's happening?
- There's a bruxa in the house.

548
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:12,750
A what? What are you doing?

549
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:15,416
What's going on, Geralt?

550
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,500
Move.

551
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:18,625
Now.

552
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:03,916
Oh…

553
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:22,083
Vereena?

554
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:27,541
He hurt me.

555
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:31,625
Cirilla.

556
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,166
She's the bruxa.

557
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,125
Get back to Roach.

558
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:49,500
<i>Don't run.</i>

559
00:48:51,916 --> 00:48:54,416
Uh… I can't help myself if you run.

560
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:55,875
He's wrong.

561
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:58,833
I don't want to hurt you.

562
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:23,583
Geralt!

563
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:31,291
Geralt!

564
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:50,541
Cirilla.

565
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:53,416
- Geralt, wait. Please.
- Get away from it.

566
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:01,000
I'll rip her throat out

567
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:03,708
unless you leave us alone!

568
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:13,958
I'm sorry.

569
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,875
I'm so sorry.

570
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:33,875
Mine…

571
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:40,500
…or nobody's.

572
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:47,208
I love you.

573
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:53,625
Love you.

574
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:55,041
Huh?

575
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,583
No!

576
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:02,166
No!

577
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:05,000
No!

578
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:11,791
<i>He'll come for you too.</i>

579
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:40,875
Why, Geralt?

580
00:52:44,916 --> 00:52:45,875
It's wrong.

581
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:47,916
It's wrong.

582
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:50,750
It's all wrong!

583
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,083
The curse has lifted.

584
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:56,916
You are free now.

585
00:52:58,416 --> 00:52:59,291
Free?

586
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,708
This is what you call…

587
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:06,000
Free?

588
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:13,666
I found her in the woods.

589
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:15,958
Injured.

590
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:17,625
Starving.

591
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:21,666
She wasn't scared of me.

592
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:24,916
And when she healed…

593
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:28,833
She chose to stay.

594
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,250
She didn't care…

595
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:34,125
What I looked like.

596
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,041
And to ease her cravings,

597
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:39,875
I let her feed on me.

598
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:43,166
- But...
- She couldn't control herself?

599
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:47,666
She was a monster.

600
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:51,625
No.

601
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:55,583
That's not true.

602
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:00,041
It doesn't matter
if she was or wasn't.

603
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:03,208
She loved you.

604
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:07,833
Love and blood.

605
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:11,750
They both possess a mighty power.

606
00:54:14,291 --> 00:54:17,958
Learned men and mages have wracked
their brains over it for years.

607
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:23,708
- And they've arrived at nothing except…
- …true love.

608
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,500
To lose…

609
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:30,583
True love.

610
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:34,291
That's what it is.

611
00:54:45,458 --> 00:54:46,500
I knowingly…

612
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:51,000
Turned my eyes away
from what she did to the villagers,

613
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:53,916
because she didn't care

614
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,750
that I was cursed all those years ago.

615
00:54:57,958 --> 00:54:59,833
Not for destroying the temple.

616
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:04,916
For raping the priestess.

617
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:12,083
Ciri…

618
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:31,208
Please stay. Don't go.

619
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:34,083
I beg you.

620
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:36,791
Use your sword.

621
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:39,000
End this.

622
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,125
For me.

623
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:44,625
You're mortal now.

624
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:47,708
Do it yourself.

625
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:29,916
When I say run,

626
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:32,500
you run.

627
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:35,500
When I say hide,

628
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:37,708
you hide.

629
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,666
- And when I say get to Roach...
- I know.

630
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:54,708
I think there's something wrong with me.

631
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,916
Everywhere I go, people die.

632
00:57:05,958 --> 00:57:06,916
Sometimes, I…

633
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:12,083
I feel like I could…

634
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:15,291
Burn the whole world.

635
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:19,250
I wouldn't mean to.

636
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:21,375
Just…

637
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:24,458
It just makes me feel so afraid.

638
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,250
All the time.

639
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:31,250
Fear is an illness.

640
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:35,625
If you catch it
and you leave it untreated,

641
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:37,958
it can consume you.

642
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:41,666
How do you treat it?

643
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,208
You face it.

644
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:46,458
Facing your fear is not easy.

645
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:49,375
But I am here for you.

646
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:53,708
I won't let anything happen to you.

647
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:00,166
All right.

648
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:17,958
Enough! To your feet!

649
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:22,166
Cut what you need, and get moving.
We need to reach Cintra by dawn.

650
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:23,875
Look at them.

651
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:27,208
You're leading them
to a salvation that doesn't exist.

652
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:29,708
How long before they turn on you?

653
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:33,916
Archers!

654
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,708
Release me. You know
I'm more powerful.

655
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:39,875
- I can save us.
- I've got nothing!

656
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,500
- Where are they?
- I can't see 'em.
